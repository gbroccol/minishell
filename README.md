# minishell

Minishell is a simple implementation of a shell in C. It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works.

Commands must be on a single line.
Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
No piping or redirection.
Only builtins are: cd, help, exit.
